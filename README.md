# PRJ_StrateGoWeb
In this private fullstack side-project an online game named 'StrateGo' is going to be developed by using the React Library and streamchat API. 
This project was created to get familiar with the development of web applications and corresponding frameworks.
This game is derived from the original boardgame 'Stratego Original'.
