# PRJ_StrateGoWeb
In this private project a online game named 'StrateGo' is going to be developed by using the React Library and Web-Socket. 
This project was created to get familiar with the development of web applications and using required frameworks.
This game is derived from the original boardgame 'Stratego Original'.
