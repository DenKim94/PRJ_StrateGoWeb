# PRJ_StrateGoWeb
Developer: Denis Kim

In this private side project, a multiplayer online game named 'StrateGo' is being developed from scratch using the React library for the frontend and Express JS (+ Stream Chat API) for the backend. 
This project was created to become familiar with web application development using specific frameworks and tools. 
The game is derived from the original board game 'Stratego Original.'

Feel free to review my code (I am a beginner) and provide constructive feedback. ;)
